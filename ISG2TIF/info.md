Matlab ISG format utilities
Matlab functions to read and write geoid/quasi-geoid models in ISG format. The reader is able to read all the versions of the format (v 1.0, v 1.01 and v 2.0), while the writer can write models only according to the newest v 2.0 of the format, since the older ones are deprecated.

The zip package contains the two functions and an example on their usage
